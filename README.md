For the Twitter Sentiment Analysis, I used the tweepy API to connect to Twitter and the textblob library for NLP.

After authenticating with twitter, I search for a keyword/keyphrase. In my case, I looked up "Arnold Schwarzenegger"

When I run the code, I see whether the keyword: "Arnold Schwarzenegger" has a positive or a negative sentiment in the Twitter community
