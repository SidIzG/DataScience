# 1. Gender Classifier

In this project, I predicted the genders of people based on their height and weight using machine learning. I provided my machine learning model a data set with contained the height and weight of a person and their corressponding gender. The model is trained on that data and so I am able to predict a person's gender based on their height and weight.

# 2. Twitter Sentiment Analysis:

I used the tweepy API to connect to Twitter and the textblob library for NLP. After authenticating with twitter, I search for a keyword/keyphrase. In my case, I looked up "Arnold Schwarzenegger". My goal is to see if the topic has a positive or a negative connotation to it. I made an empty list, and added the polarity of each tweet that has the keyword or key phrase. Then I took the average of that list which gives me the overall sentiment about the topic.

# 3. Movie Recommendation System

This project takes in a dataset of movies and their ratings. Then based on those ratings, the program will use machine learning to provide recommendations on which other movies a user would like.
